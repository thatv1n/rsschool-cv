# About me

I like the IT sphere, I follow the emergence of new technologies, I tried different directions, but most of
all I liked Web development. I made my choice in favor of the front-end direction, because you can
immediately see the result of your work, make interesting features, animations, as well as work in a
team, since you always learn something new, make new acquaintances with more experienced people,
thereby constantly evolving and not standing still
